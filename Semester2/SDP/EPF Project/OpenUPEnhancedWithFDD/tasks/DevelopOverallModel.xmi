    <sectionDescription>The modeling team should consist of analysts and&amp;nbsp;the chief&amp;nbsp;architect, senior developers may be part of this team&#xD;
to help identify&amp;nbsp;and clarify technical issues. As the Object Model is sketched out it should be checked with the&#xD;
domain expert once in a while to validate the changes.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a presentation of the problem domain by domain experts because they have been in the business for a long time&#xD;
    and understand&amp;nbsp;most if not all&amp;nbsp;subtilities of&amp;nbsp;it however it is possible to omit some key information&#xD;
    because domain experts consider it to be &quot;known&quot;. Some things just slip by because they are usual things in a days work&#xD;
    but not everyone works in the same domain, such information can be vital in building the Overall Object Model.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While studying documents it is possible that the information within the documents to not be clear enough,&amp;nbsp;outdated&#xD;
    or the documents themselves to be isufficient. Because of this the step is repetitive. As long as the requirements are&#xD;
    not clear enough the team continues to study the documents, new ones may arrive and outdates ones may be skipped.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The problem domain is usually rich and can be split into smaller pieces called domain areas. Each domain area is&#xD;
    refined and illustrated through an Object Model of its own. Later on all Small Group Models are merged by the chief&#xD;
    architect obtaining the Object Model of the problem domain.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_gW4ygAehEeWly8KELFU4ng" name="Develop Team Model" guid="_gW4ygAehEeWly8KELFU4ng">
    <sectionDescription>A problem usually has more than one solution. For each solution there is a model and at this step one of those models or&#xD;
merging ideas from different models is chosen for the problem domain.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_PBMugAegEeWly8KELFU4ng" name="Refine Overall Object Model" guid="_PBMugAegEeWly8KELFU4ng">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Overall Object Model is composed of multiple smaller Domain Area Object Models it is possible to contain similar&#xD;
    concepts that in fact represent the same thing or other sorts of duplications or anomalies. The Overall Object Model&#xD;
    has to be cleaned after each merge however there are usually more ways to do this resulting in multiple model proposals&#xD;
    that are sound. When this happens the team has to decide which one to use, in short they cycle through Develop Team&#xD;
    Model step and Refine Overall Object Model until the final model is sound.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this step UML (interaction and static structure) diagrams can be drawn to better illustrate how the domain works.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_mV3AcAejEeWly8KELFU4ng" name="Write Model Notes" guid="_mV3AcAejEeWly8KELFU4ng">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As diagrams are drawn it is possible to end up with complex diagrams, for each of those it is recommended to keep&#xD;
    explanatory notes in order to ease understanding in future development tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Build a mainly structural model of the problem domain called the Object Model.&#xD;
